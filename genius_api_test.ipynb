    "- Ensures reliable downloads for academic research\n",
    "- Models responsible data collection practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Settings:**\n",
    "- **2-3 second delays** between requests (conservative for education)\n",
    "- **20 second timeouts** (handles slower connections)\n",
    "- **Automatic retries** for failed requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**When You Might Adjust Rates:**\n",
    "- **Small projects (1-10 songs)**: Could reduce to `genius.sleep_time = 1`\n",
    "- **Large datasets (50+ songs)**: Increase delays to `genius.sleep_time = 3-5`\n",
    "- **Multiple students using same network**: Keep conservative settings\n",
    "- **Personal research projects**: Could experiment with faster rates\n",
