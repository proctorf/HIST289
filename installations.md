# Installations

This document contains information about software installations and setup requirements for HIST 289.

### Required Software


- [Drive for Desktop](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/13022292?hl=en) and  [Google Drive Explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cQHefWqXcXQq9bbJGlev4kIz2uE7f6xvC0s79sdC3sI/edit?usp=sharing)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) and  - Create an account (ideally using a .edu email for access to all features).
* [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) - Select you operating system, download, and install.
* [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) - Apply for additional access for advanced models and usage limits. 
>Importantly, when you try to create a GitHub Education account you are likely to be denied, or better encouraged to use **Two Factor Authentication**. When you receive this request follow the instructions in the email you receive and when you arrive at a screen with a QR code, use DUO to scan it - open the DUO app, select "Add", and scan the QR code. (This will operate much like logging into your denison.edu accounts)


* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Select "Download" for your operating system
