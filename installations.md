# Installations

This document contains information about software installations and setup requirements for HIST 289.

### Required Software


- [Drive for Desktop](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/13022292?hl=en) and  [Google Drive Explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cQHefWqXcXQq9bbJGlev4kIz2uE7f6xvC0s79sdC3sI/edit?usp=sharing)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) and  - Create an account (ideally using a .edu email for access to all features).
* [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) - Select you operating system, download, and install.
* [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) - Apply for additional access for advanced models and usage limits. 
    - Importantly, when you try to create a GitHub Education account you are likely to be denied, or better encouraged to use **Two Factor Authentication**. When you receive this request follow the instructions in the email you receive and when you arrive at a screen with a QR code, use DUO to scan it - open the DUO app, select "Add", and scan the QR code. (This will operate much like logging into your denison.edu accounts)


* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Select "Download" for your operating system

**Recommended Downloads**

* [Denison VPN](https://my.denison.edu/campus-resources/information-technology-services/service-catalog/internet-and-network/global-protect-vpn)
 This will allow you to connect to the Denison Network from anywhere in the world (if you are off campus)
 * [VIA](https://my.denison.edu/campus-resources/information-technology-services/service-catalog/classroom-technology-and-equipment/wireless-classroom-projection) This will allow you to share your screen on the projector screens in classrooms (you can add this put typing in the numbered webaddress on the screen once VIA has been selected from the podium)
