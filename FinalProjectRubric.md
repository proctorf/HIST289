# Digital History Team Project Rubric: Enslaved Fugitives in the United States

## Project Overview
Teams of up to 3 students will design and complete a web-born research project that poses a historical question about the experiences of enslaved fugitives Ohioe (or in the United States) and uses digital tools to investigate and present findings. Projects must be grounded in primary source data and accessible through web-based platforms.
