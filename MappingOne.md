## The Interactive Map (Lab Two)

The ideas of \"place\" and \"community,\" along with what it means **Attribution**: This assignment is adapted from materials originally created by Emily Johnson and Anastasia Salter as a companion to their book *Critical Making in the Age of AI*.

a member of a community, being from a place, or occupying a
place\--physically or virtually\--is a very \"humanities\" question.

For this lab, you will create your own **Interactive Map.** I want you
to think deeply about place, space, community, **and the context of each
of these,** and then make a **statement** about it with your project. 

 

### Where to Start 

- Look at the examples and resources in this module.
- Consider the ideas and our understandings of place, space, and and how that influences our ideas of the world.
- Think about location in terms of: globe, continent, country, city, county, neighborhood.
- Think about context, change over time, movement over time (migrations, glaciers, etc.).
- THEN look at the feature options to best tell your story.

### What is Due 

1.   A link to your Interactive Map **on your digital portfolio** that:

    -   has **meaningful** interactive elements (at least one layer or
        other data in addition to a map)

    -   makes a critical statement that calls attention to, questions,
        critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of humanity

    -   feels complete

2.  An abstract that **is posted on your digital portfolio or embedded
    within the project **(or both) that:

    -   clearly and thoroughly explains how your project calls attention
        to, questions, critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of
        humanity

    -   is between 100-200 words

    -   includes at least one citation in proper MLA or APA format.

        -   Citation means a scholarly source. [Search

### **Google Earth**

Google Earth Web: <https://earth.google.com/web/>  (requires a Chrome
browser AND a Google account)

Google Earth Desktop: <https://www.google.com/earth/versions/> (requires
a download)

#### Overview 

Google Earth allows you to create an annotated map. This could outline
and explain a factual, historical journey using modern map locations
(such as the path of the Olympic torch), it could explain where events
that predate modern countries took place (such as the journey of the
ancient Roman army), or it could follow the path of fictional characters
created by you or someone else. 

Google Earth Web is a download-free tool that requires a [Google
account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount) and the [Chrome
browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/). If you already have a
Google account and wish to create a  blank/dummy account, you will need
to either log out or open an [incognito
window](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3356840/how-to-go-incognito-in-chrome-firefox-safari-and-edge.html) in
your browser.  The Google Earth Desktop does not require the use of a
browser, but I think the download may be rather large.
