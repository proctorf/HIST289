## The Interactive Map (Lab Two)

The ideas of \"place\" and \"community,\" along with what it means be
a member of a community, being from a place, or occupying a
place\--physically or virtually\--is a very \"humanities\" question.

For this lab, you will create your own **Interactive Map.** I want you
to think deeply about place, space, community, **and the context of each
of these,** and then make a **statement** about it with your project. 

 

### Where to Start 

- Look at the examples and resources in this module.
- Consider the ideas and our understandings of place, space, and and how that influences our ideas of the world.
- Think about location in terms of: globe, continent, country, city, county, neighborhood.
- Think about context, change over time, movement over time (migrations, glaciers, etc.).
- THEN look at the feature options to best tell your story.

### What is Due 

1.   A GoodleDoc that includes a link to your Interactive Map that:

    -   has **meaningful** interactive elements (at least one layer or
        other data in addition to a map)

    -   makes a critical statement that calls attention to, questions,
        critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of humanity

    -   feels complete

2.  An abstract that **is posted on your digital portfolio or embedded
    within the project **(or both) that:

    -   clearly and thoroughly explains how your project calls attention
        to, questions, critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of
        humanity

    -   is between 100-200 words

    -   includes at least one citation in proper *Chicago Manual of Style* format.

        -   Citation means a scholarly source. [Search
            here](https://guides.ucf.edu/c.php?g=78763&p=508976) or
            [maybe even here](https://scholar.google.com/)

### **Google Earth**

Google Earth Web: <https://earth.google.com/web/>  (requires a Chrome
browser AND a Google account)

Google Earth Desktop: <https://www.google.com/earth/versions/> (requires
a download)

#### Overview 

Google Earth allows you to create an annotated map. This could outline
and explain a factual, historical journey using modern map locations
(such as the path of the Olympic torch), it could explain where events
that predate modern countries took place (such as the journey of the
ancient Roman army), or it could follow the path of fictional characters
created by you or someone else. 

Google Earth Web is a download-free tool that requires a [Google
account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount) and the [Chrome
browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/). If you already have a
Google account and wish to create a  blank/dummy account, you will need
to either log out or open an [incognito
window](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3356840/how-to-go-incognito-in-chrome-firefox-safari-and-edge.html) in
your browser.  The Google Earth Desktop does not require the use of a
browser, but I think the download may be rather large.

#### CARTO



Pros and Cons of Google Earth and Carto (according to ChatGPT)
---
**Carto:**

Carto is an accessible, cloud-based platform designed to help users easily create interactive and visually engaging maps by working with spatial data. It allows beginners to upload datasets, customize map layers with various colors, symbols, and labels, and add interactive features such as filters, time-series anaimation, and pop-ups to tell geographic stories and reveal patterns. Its intuitive interface and user-friendly tools make it a great resource for those new to digital mapping, enabling users to explore and communicate complex spatial information without needing advanced technical skills

**Sign-Up**
    - You have free access to Carto thanks to your github education account.
    - go to <a href="https://carto.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carto.com</a>
    - Select Sign "Log in"
    - **STOP AND PAY ATTENTION** When you arrive on the login page, look at the bottom where it asks "Are you a student", select the down arrow, and then <a href="https://app.carto.com/students" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Access Using Github"</a>
    - Use your Github credentials to gain access (you will always need to log in this way). 
    - ***Warning*** When you arrive at the screen asking for an Organization, you need to create your own.  Do not select one that might auto populate.

- User-Friendly Interface: Designed for beginners with intuitive drag-and-drop features, making complex mapping accessible.
- Web-Based Platform: No installation needed; maps can be shared easily online.

**Cons:**

- Learning Curve: May require some initial time to understand dataset formatting and advanced features.
Limited Satellite Imagery: Less focus on real-time or detailed satellite views compared to Google Earth.


**Google Earth:**

*Pros:*

- Visual Appeal: Offers stunning satellite imagery and 3D terrain, making maps visually engaging.
- Ease of Use: Simple to navigate and explore geographic locations without technical complexity.
- Familiar Interface: Many students find it intuitive due to its widespread use and visual focus.

*Cons:*

- Less Data Visualization Flexibility: Not designed for complex data analysis or creating layered statistical maps.
- Limited Interactivity: While you can add placemarks and info windows, it lacks advanced interactivity and customization options found in Carto.
- Focus on Exploration: Primarily for viewing and exploring places rather than creating detailed, data-driven stories.
