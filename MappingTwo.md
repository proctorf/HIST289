### StoryMap.JS

**StoryMap.JS: <https://storymap.knightlab.com/> **

#### Overview 

StoryMap.JS is a free tool created at the Northwestern University Knight
Lab intended to be user-friendly. The tool allows you to add information
(text and images) on top of images and maps. The projects are organized
in slides, much like Google Slides, but with StoryMap.JS, the author has
the freedom to select any image to traverse with their story.
